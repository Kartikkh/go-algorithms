# Welcome to the Go Algorithms

The goal of this project is to **explain how algorithms work**. The focus is on clarity and readability of the code, not on making a reusable library that you can drop into your own projects. That said, most of the code should be ready for production use but you may need to tweak it to fit into your own codebase.

## The algorithms

### Searching

- [Linear Search](Search/linearSearch/)
- [Binary Search](Search/binarySearch/)
- [Count Occurrences](Search/countOccurrences/)
- [Select Minimum / Maximum](Search/minmax/)
- [k-th Largest Element](Search/kthLargest/)
- [Interpolation Search](Search/interpolationSearch/)
- [Jump Search](Search/jumpSearch/)

### Sorting

Basic sorts:

- [Insertion Sort](Sort/insertionSort/)
- [Selection Sort](Sort/selectionSort/)
- [Shell Sort](Sort/shellSort/)

Fast sorts:

- [Quicksort](Sort/quickSort/)
- [Merge Sort](Sort/mergeSort/)
- [Heap Sort](Sort/heapSort/)

Special-purpose sorts:

- [Counting Sort](Sort/quickSort/)
- [Radix Sort](Sort/radixSort/)

## Data structures

- [Stack](DataStructures/stack/). Last-in, first-out!
